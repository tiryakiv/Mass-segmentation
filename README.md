# Mass-segmentation

This repository includes mass segmentation investigation using U-net++Xception-based segmentation models. The first step includes a breast segmentation and the second step includes the mass segmentation. The two step enabled to focus only on the mass segmentation.

In the first step five-layer U-net was found to have the hightest breast segmentation performance.

The references for models are given at the top line as a comment.
